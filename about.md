### Who am I ?

Hi, I am Bhargav Voleti, a full stack web developer who graduated 8 months ago.
Since graduating, I have worked at [Recruiterbox](https://recruiterbox.com)
helping build a functional and complete applicant tracking system.

My primary programming languages are python and javascript, but I have also
worked in several other languages such as java, go-lang and rust. Some of my
open source work is present on my [GitHub](https://github.com/bIgBV) account.

Other than programming, I am a musician who plays the guitar, a music lover who
frequents various concerts and events happening in the city and an avid
traveler who's out to explore the world.

### How do I get in touch with you ?

You can find me on twitter as [@2093bps](https://twitter.com/2093bps) or you
can send me an email at
[bhargav@voletibhargav.me](mailto:bhargav@voletibhargav.me)
